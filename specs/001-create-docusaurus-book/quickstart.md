# Quickstart Guide

**Date**: 2025-12-07
**Context**: This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment and getting started with adding content to the digital textbook.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: You must have Node.js (LTS version) installed.
- **npm** or **yarn**: A package manager for installing dependencies.

## 1. Local Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd my_digital_book
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    This command will install Docusaurus and all other required packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *or*
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## 2. Running the Development Server

To preview the website locally, run the following command. This will start a local development server with live reloading.

```bash
npm run start
```
*or*
```bash
yarn start
```

Once the server is running, you can view the site by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## 3. Authoring Content

The main workflow for adding and editing content is as follows:

1.  **Create or Edit Markdown Files**:
    - All book content is located in the `/docs` directory.
    - To create a new page, add a new `.md` file.
    - To create a new chapter, create a new sub-directory within `/docs`.

2.  **Update Sidebar (if needed)**:
    - The sidebar is configured in `sidebars.js`.
    - For simplicity, this project uses the `autogenerated` sidebar, which automatically creates the navigation based on the folder structure in `/docs`. No manual edits to `sidebars.js` are needed if you follow the directory structure.

3.  **Preview Changes**:
    - The local development server will automatically reload as you save files, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

## 4. Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow. When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the site will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages.
