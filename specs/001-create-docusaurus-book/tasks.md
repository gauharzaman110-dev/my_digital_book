# Tasks: Create Digital Textbook with Docusaurus

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-create-docusaurus-book/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Based on the decision in `research.md`, End-to-End (E2E) tests will be created for each user story using Playwright.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure.

- [x] T001 Initialize Node.js project with `npm init -y` in the root directory.
- [ ] T002 Install Docusaurus and React dependencies with `npm install @docusaurus/core @docusaurus/preset-classic react react-dom`.
- [ ] T003 [P] Install Playwright for E2E testing with `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`.
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure Playwright by creating a `playwright.config.js` file.
- [ ] T005 Create the initial Docusaurus project structure by running `npx docusaurus-init`. This will create the `docs`, `src`, `blog` directories and config files.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: This project is simple and does not have foundational tasks that block all user stories beyond the initial setup. This phase is intentionally left empty.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Initialize Docusaurus Site (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Set up a new Docusaurus website for the digital textbook so that content can be added and organized.

**Independent Test**: A new Docusaurus site is created and can be run locally via `npm run start`, accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Tests for User Story 1 ⚠️

- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Create an E2E test in `tests/e2e/homepage.spec.js` that verifies the homepage loads and displays the main title.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T007 [US1] Update the `docusaurus.config.js` file with the correct project information (`title`, `tagline`, `url`, `baseUrl`).

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. The basic Docusaurus site can be run locally.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Structure the Book Content (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Add chapters and sections to the book so that the content is logically organized.

**Independent Test**: New markdown files for chapters and sections can be added, and they appear in the site's sidebar navigation.

### Tests for User Story 2 ⚠️

- [ ] T008 [P] [US2] Create an E2E test in `tests/e2e/sidebar.spec.js` that verifies new pages and chapters appear in the sidebar.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T009 [P] [US2] Create the "Getting Started" page at `docs/intro.md`. (FR-007)
- [ ] T010 [P] [US2] Create a sample "About" page at `src/pages/about.js`. (FR-008)
- [ ] T011 [US2] Create a sample chapter directory `docs/chapter-1`.
- [ ] T012 [P] [US2] Create a sample page within the chapter at `docs/chapter-1/part-1.md`.
- [ ] T013 [US2] Update `sidebars.js` to ensure the new chapter and pages are reflected in the navigation (if not using 'autogenerated').

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 2 should be functional. The site should have a basic structure that is visible in the navigation.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Deploy to GitHub Pages (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Automatically deploy the Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages so that the book is publicly accessible.

**Independent Test**: Changes pushed to the `main` branch trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that successfully builds and deploys the site to the public GitHub Pages URL.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T014 [US3] Update `docusaurus.config.js` with deployment-specific fields: `organizationName`, `projectName`, and `deploymentBranch`.
- [ ] T015 [US3] Create the GitHub Actions workflow directory `.github/workflows/`.
- [ ] T016 [US3] Create the deployment workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with steps to build and deploy the Docusaurus site.

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional. The site is ready for automated deployment.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories.

- [ ] T017 Update the root `README.md` with setup and usage instructions from `quickstart.md`.
- [ ] T018 Manually validate all site links and navigation paths.
- [ ] T019 Run a Lighthouse audit on the deployed site to check performance goals (SC-003).

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Must be completed first.
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: Depend on Setup completion. They can be worked on sequentially (P1 → P2 → P3).
- **Polish (Phase N)**: Depends on all user stories being complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1.
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 1 and 2.

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Within Setup**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel.
- **Within User Stories**: Tasks marked with [P] can be run in parallel within their respective stories.
- **Across User Stories**: Once setup is complete, different developers could potentially work on different user stories, but the dependencies noted above should be respected.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup.
2. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1.
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that the basic Docusaurus site runs locally. This is the MVP.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete MVP → A runnable, barebones site exists.
2. Add User Story 2 → The site now has content structure.
3. Add User Story 3 → The site is now auto-deployed.
4. Complete Polish phase → The project is production-ready.
